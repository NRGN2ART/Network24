Network 24
Andrew Seawright -- 2024

Anodized aluminum, neon glow lamps, custom electronics.

Network 24 is a tribute to my father James L. Seawright. Network 24 is a sound responsive sculpture that explores wave motion.

This sculpture uses the Neon glow lamps from the decommissioned Network IV sculpture. Network IV was in the Seattle-Tacoma Airport for several decades. The Neon glow lights from Network IV were saved as these lights are no longer manufactured.
James Seawright created several sculptures in the “Network” series. Network I and Network II created in 1969 are sound responsive pieces using neon glow lights of different varieties. As explained before, Network IV 1973 was an interactive art installation in Seattle-Tacoma Airport.
Inspirations for Network 24 are James Seawright’s Network art works, hexagonal forms in nature and science, and wave motion. The Network 24 sculpture uses modern electronics while aiming to fit in with the style of James Seawright’s Network sculptures. Similarities of Network 24 to my father’s Network sculptures are the use of Neon glow lights, sound responsiveness, and physical styling. Some contrasts to the other Network pieces is the control of the light values over a spectrum of intensity values (not just on/off) and wave motion patterns.
Network 24 is currently with Network I and Network II in Middletown NY.
